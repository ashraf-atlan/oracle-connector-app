# Project Setup Rule

This guide automatically detects your operating system and provides the appropriate setup instructions to get the Atlan PostgreSQL App running.


## Guidelines (IMPORTANT)

- Before installing anything new, make sure to check if the specific version for the component already exists.
    - Example: Start by installing the correct version of python via pyenv if the version of python doesn't exist in system.
    - Versions must match the exact semver. Also mention this while laying out the plan.
- Always check what part of the setup step is already done (example: if the required version of python already exists, inform and proceed.)
- You must not perform any other operation than the ones mentioned in the guides (eg: brew install python@3.11, follow pyenv installation instead), unless you are troubleshooting an issue.


## Manual Selection

If the automatic detection doesn't work, please open the appropriate guide based on your operating system:

- [MAC.md](mdc:docs/setup/MAC.md)
- [LINUX.md](mdc:docs/setup/LINUX.md)
- [WINDOWS.md](mdc:docs/setup/WINDOWS.md)

1. Python 3.11.10
2. uv 0.7.3
