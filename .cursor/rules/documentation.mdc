# Documentation for Atlan Apps

Detailed instructions and examples for creating high-quality Atlan app documentation. This expanded ruleset provides concrete templates, examples, and best practices for each document type following the Docs-as-Code methodology. Reference this guide when you need specific formatting guidance, document structure templates, or persona-focused writing strategies.

## Document Structure
Follow Atlan's Docs-as-Code framework when creating documentation for apps:

1. **Content Categories**: Organize content into these types:
   - How-to guides (task-oriented instructions)
   - Concepts (explanatory content)
   - References (technical specifications)
   - Tutorials (learning-oriented guides)
   - Troubleshooting (solutions to common issues)

2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Use lowercase, hyphen-separated file names
   - Keep names descriptive and concise
   - Main intro file should be named `intro.md`

3. **Metadata**:
   - Include title and description in front matter
   - Add relevant tags for search optimization
   - Define custom slugs only when necessary

4. **User-Centric Approach**:
   - Target specific user personas (Builders, Installers, Source System Admins, Consumers, App Users)
   - Focus on tasks relevant to the targeted persona
   - Structure content to match user workflow

5. **Format**:
   - Write in Markdown (.md)
   - Use sections with clear headings
   - Include prerequisites and next steps where appropriate
   - Follow consistent formatting for code blocks, notes, and warnings

Use this rule as your foundation for all documentation. More detailed guidelines are available in the documentation-guidelines.mdc file.
